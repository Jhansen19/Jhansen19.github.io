    <h3>Project 1</h3>
    <p>After natural disasters, a quick and accurate damage assessment is crucial for an effective response. The core problem our project seeks to address is how to provide a faster and reliable damage assessment of disaster areas. To achieve this goal, the project performed fine-tuning on a DeepLabV3 model with a natural disaster image dataset called RescueNet. The model achieved an IoU score of 50.6% after only 7 epochs of training. While not the level of performance the team was looking for, the model performed well given the limited computational resources.</p>
